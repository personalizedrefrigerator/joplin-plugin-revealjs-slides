# Translations
Please translate each of the strings in the right column (everything after the `: `) into the target language.

If you're updating an existing translation, please only include the strings you translated.

Ignore the surrounding single quotes. For example, to translate `exit: 'Exit',` to Spanish, please replace it with `exit: 'Cerrar',`.

	startSlideshow: 'Start slideshow',
	exit: 'Exit',
	endOfDeck: 'End of deck',
	showExitButton: 'Show exit button',
	print: 'Print',

 If you have development experience and are comfortable creating a pull request, please consider doing so â€” the translations can be added to ./src/localization.ts .
